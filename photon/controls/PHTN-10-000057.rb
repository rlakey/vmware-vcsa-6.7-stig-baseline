  desc  "Audit logs are most useful when accessible by date, rather than size.
This can be acomplished through a combination of an audit log rotation cron
job, setting a reasonable number of logs to keep and configuring auditd to not
rotate the logs on it's own. This ensures that audit logs are accessible to the
ISSO in the event of a central log processing failure."
