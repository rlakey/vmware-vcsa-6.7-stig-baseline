  desc  "Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and
investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable
allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of
time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems
connected over a network.

    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to
the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical
endpoints).
